Hey there! Iâ€™m **Divyansh Pathak**, and about 1.5 months ago, I embarked on an exciting journey that has completely transformed my lifeâ€”learning to code.

## From Zero to VStart ðŸš€

I started from scratch, diving into programming with pure curiosity and excitement. Fast forward to now, and Iâ€™m deep into developing my first project, **VStart**, which I plan to launch in December. Itâ€™s been a wild ride, filled with late-night coding sessions, plenty of errors, and small wins that keep me going. VStart is my passion projectâ€”a platform designed to help startups and teams collaborate more efficiently through innovative features like **VCode**, **VPages**, and **VChat**.

### What is VStart?

VStart is all about making the journey of building a startup as smooth as possible. From planning to communicating, it offers everything a small team needs to scale without friction. Weâ€™re talking about powerful tools for developers, planners, and creators, all in one place.

1. **VCode - Code Together**: A collaborative coding platform integrated with Code OSS that allows developers to work on the same project simultaneously, almost like your own version of VSCode in the cloud.
  
2. **VPages - Plan for the Future**: This feature lets teams plan collaboratively with various page types like Kanban boards, whiteboards, to-do lists, and more, offering flexibility and organization in one unified space.
  
3. **VChat - Effective Communication**: A real-time chat platform to keep the conversation going between team members, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

### Building VStart

Developing VStart has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. Itâ€™s pushed me to learn about **full-stack development**, **real-time communication** (shoutout to `socket.io`!), and so many other technologies like **Supabase** for database management and **SCSS** for styling. Every feature I build feels like another step toward creating something meaningful.

I canâ€™t wait to launch VStart in December. If you're interested in joining the waitlist, drop by the homepage and sign up to get early access!

## XonX Records ðŸŽµ

But thatâ€™s not all! Alongside VStart, Iâ€™m working on another dream projectâ€”**XonX Records**, my very own record label. Music has always been a huge part of my life, and now, Iâ€™m taking it a step further by releasing music under different aliases. From **The BRKN**, our flagship alias for high-quality music, to **Ravient** and **Aileron**, itâ€™s been amazing to create and share what I love with the world.

## The Path Ahead

If Iâ€™ve learned anything in the past few months, itâ€™s that persistence pays off. When I started learning to code, I had no idea Iâ€™d be this far along, building complex applications like VStart. Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for the support Iâ€™ve received, from mentors to the amazing coding community, and Iâ€™m excited to see where the future takes me.

If youâ€™re someone looking to build something or are simply interested in tech, startups, or music, feel free to connect with me! Thereâ€™s a lot more to come, and Iâ€™d love for you to be a part of this journey.

Stay tuned, and keep creating!
